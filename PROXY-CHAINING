chaining sash tunnels with an SOCKS proxy endpoint:

ssh -t -L 8887:localhost:8886 root@superking.org ssh -t -L 8886:localhost:8885 root@funblog.me ssh -t -g -D 8885 root@superking.org
------------------------------------------------ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ------------------------------------
command on localhost				 command on superking			       command on funblog

1. on localhost the port 8887 is bound. connections to localhost:8887 will be forwarded to superking:8886
2. on superking the port 8886 is bound. connections to superking:8886 will be forwarded to funblog:8885
3. on funblog the port 8885 is bound and acts as a SOCKS proxy.

you will have a SOCKS proxy on localhost:8887

alternative you can do 3-2-1 manually:

from localhost ssh to funblog an type:
fublog$: sash -D 8885 root@superking.org [note the missing -g!]

from localhost ssh to superking an type:
superking$: ssh -t -L 8886:localhost:8885 root@funblog.me

on localhost:
localhost$: ssh -t -L 8887:localhost:8886 root@superking.org
